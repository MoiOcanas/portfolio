                <p>I am a calm and focused person who can work individually and as part of
                    a work team. In the last 2 years I have worked with different
                    technologies as a web developer. I have the ability to learn quickly
                    and not give up on what I do.
                    I love my family, my friends, my dog and this great profession.</p>

                <p>I was part of a development team that used different
                    technologies for the development of two large projects.
                    I worked as Full Stack Web Developer using technologies
                    such as React for user interfaces and Node using Express
                    for the backend. For the database service, I used MongoDB.
                    And other tools involved in the MERN development.
                    I had the opportunity to learn things
                    from hard-working people and many other important work values.</p>
